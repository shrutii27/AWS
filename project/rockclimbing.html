<P>Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. 
The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. 
Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. 
Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.
